Welcome to my first Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Technologies used:
html- css- JavaScript -jQuery - Sass -Bootstrap

Planning Process:
-Set up Repository and prep README.md
-Create a page with some CSS to make game board.
-Create game logic by using JavaScript and use jQuery event handlers to perform functions.
-Create connection with API to be able to sign up/ in/ out/ change password for user.

Unsloved Mysteries (for now)
-Ensure X and o are different colors.
-Center the game board and some buttons.
